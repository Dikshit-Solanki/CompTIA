To understand how data moves across a network, we rely on Protocol Data Units (PDUs), also known as transmission units. These PDUs encapsulate data, enabling its transmission as a single unit across the network. Let's dissect the process layer by layer:

Layer 2 - Data Link: At this layer, data is encapsulated within a frame, typically with a Data Link Control (DLC) header. For example, in Ethernet, data is transferred between MAC addresses. The frame encapsulates the data, but the network doesn't concern itself with the content inside the frame.
Layer 3 - Network: Moving up, data is encapsulated into packets at the network layer (IP layer). Each packet is sent from one IP address to another, regardless of the data it carries inside. This encapsulation enables routing across networks.
Layer 4 - Transport: Here, data is packaged into segments or datagrams. Protocols like TCP and UDP operate at this layer, ensuring reliable or connectionless data transfer, respectively.
Layers 5, 6, and 7 - Application Layers: Data originating from applications resides at these layers. For instance, web browser data exists here. To transmit this data, it is first encapsulated with a TCP header at Layer 4, then an IP header at Layer 3, and finally a Data Link header at Layer 2 (Ethernet, for example). This encapsulation ensures the data's integrity and facilitates its transmission across the network.
Encapsulation and Decapsulation: This process involves encapsulating data at the source and decapsulating it at the destination. For instance, at the source, application data is encapsulated with TCP, IP, and Data Link headers. At the destination, these headers are removed sequentially to extract the original application data.
Control Flags: Within TCP and UDP headers, control flags determine how data is processed. Flags like SYN, PSH, RST, and FIN specify various aspects of data transmission, such as synchronization, pushing data to applications, resetting connections, and indicating the last packet.
IP Fragmentation: Data may need to be fragmented if its size exceeds the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of a network. Fragmentation divides large packets into smaller ones for transmission. However, avoiding fragmentation is preferred as it can slow down traffic and increase overhead. Knowing the MTU of each network segment is crucial for efficient communication.
Testing MTU: Tools like ping can help determine the MTU between devices. By setting the Don't Fragment bit and specifying packet sizes, you can test the maximum size of data that can be transmitted without fragmentation.
