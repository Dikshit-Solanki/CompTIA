OSI - Open System Interconnections Refrence Model
its the guideline -- describe the way to describe the way that the data moves across the network
its consist 7 layers
there are unique protocol at every layer
its the commom langauge for any IT to decribe how data is progrossing from the beginning of the traffic flow to the very end
1 commom way to memorized is layer - nimonic- all people seem to need data processing
layer 7 - Application -- your eyes information on screen
layer 6 - Presentaiton -- Application encryption(SSL/TLS) 
layer 5 - Session -- control protocols, tunneling protocols
layer 4 - Transport -- TCP segment , UDP datagram ,port number asso to them 
layer 3 - Network -- IP address, router,packets
layer 2 - Data Link -- frames, MAC address, Extended Unique Indentifier(EUI-48,EUI-64),Switch
layer 1 - Physical -- cables,fiber and the single itself

Layer 1 - Physical Layer
->The physic of the network
-Signaling, cabling, connectors
-This layer isn't about protocols
-> if Someone tells they have physical layer problem
- fix cabling,punch-downs, etc
- Run loopback test, test/replace cables, swap adapter cards

Layer 2 - Data link 
-> The basic network laguage - foundational of communications
-> Data Link Control (DLC) protocols
-MAC(Media Access Controls) address on Ethernet -layer 2 addresses
-switches make their forwading decision based on these mac address, sometimes refer switching layer

Layer 3 - Network
-> refer as routing layer
-> its asscoiating with IP addresses - any communication based on IP is on Layer 3
-> Frames are freagments into smaller pices to move those between diffrent types of networks
- if data is is moved from ethernet off to WAN network , and back to ethernet - data is being fragmentated and its occuring at layer 3

Layer 4 - Transport 
-> refer as post office layer
- how data is being delivered and wher it is being delivered into system
-> the protocols used a at layer 4 is TCP - Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

Layer 5 - Session 
-> Communication Management - (start-stop-restart) - its design to start the communication between one end point to another
-> Control protocol, tunneling protocol - ask to talk - which will set up seesion and begin commumunication

Layer 6 - Presentation
-> Character encoding - take data and put in proper way so we can understand
-> Often combined with apllication layer 

Layer 7 - Application
->the layer we see
-> HTTP,FTP,DNS,POP3 -- using any brower
