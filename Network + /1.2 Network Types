The passage is about different network topologies and how data is transferred between devices on a network.

Here are the key points:

Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks: Every device acts as both a server and a client, sharing resources directly with each other. This is easy to deploy but difficult to administer and secure.

Client-server networks: Devices (clients) communicate with a central server that stores data and applications. This offers good performance and manageability but requires additional hardware and software.

Local Area Network (LAN): A network within a limited geographical area, like a building or campus, typically using high-speed connections like ethernet.

Metropolitan Area Network (MAN): A network spanning a larger area, like a city, connecting buildings of an organization.

Wide Area Network (WAN): A network covering a large geographical distance, like a country or even the entire world. Connections are typically slower than LANs.

Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN): A wireless LAN using Wi-Fi (802.11) to connect devices within a limited area.

Personal Area Network (PAN): A network for personal devices within a short range, like Bluetooth connections for headsets or speakers.

Campus Area Network (CAN): A network connecting multiple buildings in a campus using high-speed wired connections.

Network Attached Storage (NAS): A device that stores data centrally and allows file-level access from multiple devices on the network.

Storage Area Network (SAN): A high-performance network for storage devices, enabling block-level data access for faster transfers.

Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS): A technology for routing data packets across WANs using labels for efficient forwarding.

Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN): A technology that creates dynamic connections between remote sites in a network for efficient data transfer.

Software-Defined WAN (SDWAN): A network where the configuration is software-defined, allowing for flexible routing based on traffic type and cloud applications.




With a peer-to-peer network, there's
0:03
not a server or a client.
0:05
Instead, every device is a server and a client,
0:09
so everyone is communicating to each other
0:11
to be able to gain access to the data that they might need.
0:15
This is a very easy way to deploy an application,
0:18
because you simply install it on everyone's computer,
0:21
and they all talk amongst each other
0:23
to be able to use that particular app.
0:25
You don't need an additional server.
0:27
You don't have to purchase and maintain that server operating
0:30
system.
0:31
Everything runs on everyone's existing systems,
0:34
so the cost is relatively low to implement.
0:37
One of the significant disadvantages of peer-to-peer,
0:40
however, is that it's very difficult to administer
0:43
this type of system.
0:44
The entire application is distributed.
0:47
All of the authentication process is also distributed,
0:50
so it's very difficult to be sure
0:52
that a peer-to-peer application will remain secure.
0:56
With client-server communication,
0:58
the responsibilities are split.
1:00
You have individual clients, and then
1:02
you have a centralized server, and when
1:04
clients need to access data, everyone
1:06
will access the same server.
1:09
As you can see by this diagram, clients
1:11
are not communicating to each other
1:12
directly, or even through the server.
1:15
All the clients talk to the server,
1:17
and the server talks to the clients.
1:19
This gives you very good performance,
1:20
because you have a direct connection to the server
1:23
that you can manage and maintain.
1:24
This also allows for easy administration,
1:27
because you can configure the application
1:29
and the authentication for that app at the central point
1:33
where the server is.
1:34
As you can tell with this diagram,
1:36
though, there's additional hardware and software
1:38
that you'll need.
1:38
You'll need a server, and you'll need somewhere
1:40
to store it and maintain it, and that has an additional cost
1:43
associated with it.
1:44
This also adds a bit of complexity,
1:46
because you have a centralized server that
1:48
needs to be administered.
1:50
That's something you don't have on a peer-to-peer system.
1:53
If you're working inside of an office,
1:55
or you're working from home, that network
1:57
that's in your office or in your home is a local area network.
2:01
It's local because the network that you're using
2:04
is usually within the same building
2:05
that you happen to be in.
2:07
This could also be the network that's
2:08
within a single building, for example,
2:10
between different floors.
2:12
That is a local area network, because all of those resources
2:15
are local to us in that building.
2:18
Generally speaking, a local area network
2:20
will have a relatively fast throughput.
2:22
We're using 802.11 wireless networks and ethernet
2:25
connectivity to be able to have high-speed communication.
2:29
If you find that you're using slower connections,
2:32
or it's a link that doesn't run at these higher speeds,
2:35
then you're probably not communicating
2:36
over a local area network.
2:39
Many companies will have buildings or parts
2:41
of their organization that are located
2:43
in different parts of a city to be able to communicate
2:46
to those buildings, we need to use a metropolitan area
2:49
network, or a MAN.
2:50
This is obviously a much larger network than something
2:53
that's in our single building, and it's usually expanding out
2:57
to a large, citywide area.
2:59
Usually, you're working with a third-party provider in that
3:02
city to provide this service.
3:04
Occasionally, you'll see this referred
3:05
to as metro ethernet for this metropolitan area network.
3:10
It's very common to see governments
3:11
use metropolitan area networks, because they're obviously
3:14
very geographically dispersed throughout the metropolitan
3:17
area, and they have right of way, so it's very easy for them
3:21
to put fiber in the ground and connect up
3:23
all of their remote locations.
3:25
If you're going outside the scope of a metropolitan area
3:29
network and communicating over a much larger distance,
3:32
then you're probably using a wide area network, or a WAN.
3:36
One characteristic that tends to be very common when you start
3:39
expanding the distance of these networks
3:42
is that the networks tend to become a little slower
3:44
in their throughput.
3:45
So wide area networks generally don't
3:48
run at the same speeds as a local area network
3:51
that you might have in your building.
3:53
If you're connecting over an MPLS
3:54
network or point-to-point serial WAN connection,
3:57
then you're almost certainly communicating over a wide area
4:01
network.
4:01
These can be links that are connecting us
4:03
with fiber that's in the ground, but we could also
4:05
use satellite communication, which is certainly a wide area
4:09
network, and those nonterrestrial links
4:11
would allow us to connect locations
4:13
that may be very far away.
4:15
A specialized type of local area network
4:18
is one that is wireless.
4:20
This is the WLAN, or Wireless Local Area Network,
4:24
and usually these are 802.11 networks.
4:26
If you're within a building and you're
4:28
walking from one side of the building to another
4:30
and you're connected to your local network,
4:32
then you're probably connecting over one
4:34
of these wireless LANs.
4:35
This is one that does have a limited geographical area.
4:39
When you leave your building, you're
4:40
probably not going to be able to communicate
4:42
to this WLAN because of the short distances associated
4:45
with 802.11.
4:47
But if you're in a larger area, there
4:49
are ways to extend this distance using multiple access points.
4:53
So you could be in an entire downtown area
4:55
or in multiple buildings and still maintain connectivity
4:59
to that wireless LAN.
5:01
If you have a Bluetooth headset, you're
5:03
connecting to your computer with a Bluetooth keyboard,
5:06
or using some other type of personal connection between you
5:10
and the devices you use, then you're using a personal area
5:13
network, or a PAN.
5:15
If you're in your car and you connect
5:16
to a speaker and a microphone or you play audio
5:19
through your phone to the audio system of the car,
5:22
then you're using a Bluetooth-based personal area
5:25
network.
5:26
We also consider that Bluetooth connection
5:28
to a wireless headset to be a personal area network.
5:32
And if you're using some newer workout equipment at your gym,
5:35
you'll find that is connecting to your mobile phone
5:37
using this personal area network.
5:40
There's a middle ground between a local area network
5:43
in a building and a metropolitan area network
5:46
that might connect us to a site that is many miles away.
5:49
We could have multiple buildings within our local area
5:53
on a single campus.
5:54
You certainly would see this with schools and universities,
5:57
but this could also be the same for large organizations
6:01
that may span multiple buildings in a particular area.
6:04
This is a campus area network, or a CAN,
6:07
and it's very common to have these buildings connected
6:09
with conduit, making it very easy
6:11
to pull fiber from one building to another
6:14
and connect all of your users to each other.
6:16
We would usually run some type of local area network
6:19
technology so we would have high-speed ethernet between all
6:22
of these buildings, so that we're
6:24
able to communicate as if we were sitting
6:26
all in the same building.
6:28
This is usually a connection that's made on private LAN.
6:31
You've put your own conduit into the ground,
6:33
you've run your own fiber connection,
6:34
so usually there's not a third party
6:37
that needs to be involved.
6:38
There wouldn't be a monthly payment to an internet service
6:41
provider because you're the one that has built the conduit,
6:43
you've run your own fiber, and you don't
6:45
have to involve a third party.
6:48
One of the reasons for adding all of these connections,
6:51
especially on local and wide area networks
6:53
is so that users can have access to their data
6:56
usually this data is located in a central location
6:59
and we're usually storing it on something
7:01
like a network attached storage device, or a NAS.
7:04
This NAS contains multiple drives
7:07
and is able to store large amounts of data
7:09
in this one single area.
7:11
A network attached storage is usually
7:13
a device where you can access these files at the file level.
7:17
File-level access means that any changes you make to this file
7:21
have to be done to the entire file that's
7:23
located on this device.
7:25
This means if you have a file that's a gigabyte in size,
7:28
and you just need to change one byte within that file,
7:32
you have to overwrite the entire gigabyte,
7:35
because you're using a network attached storage.
7:37
If you just wanted to change that single block of data that
7:41
contained that information, then you
7:43
would want to use a storage area network, or a SAN.
7:47
To your computer, a SAN looks and feels
7:49
a lot like the local drive that's on your system.
7:52
So being able to make block-level changes
7:54
to this information can be done very quickly and very
7:57
efficiently when compared to something like a network
8:00
attached storage device.
8:02
Whether you're using a NAS or a SAN,
8:04
you're probably going to be sending and receiving
8:07
a lot of data to these devices.
8:09
For that reason, you would probably
8:10
have a dedicated network for the storage area networks
8:14
or network attached storage devices,
8:16
and you would probably connect these with the fastest network
8:19
possible.
8:20
Through the years, we've had a number of different wide area
8:23
network technologies.
8:24
We had frame relay and ATM, and as our needs changed
8:28
and the way we use these networks changed,
8:31
we needed a smarter way to communicate.
8:33
So we created MPLS, Multiprotocol Label Switching.
8:37
This is communication through the WAN,
8:39
but it uses labels to be able to determine
8:42
how we route and forward that traffic through the WAN.
8:45
One advantage of MPLS is that we can
8:48
use almost any type of connection for MPLS
8:52
and we can put almost any type of data inside of an MPLS
8:56
network.
8:56
This means that we could send IP traffic, ethernet frames,
9:00
or any other type of data we'd like through the MPLS network.
9:03
This makes MPLS relatively easy to get up and running
9:06
and have all of our data transferred
9:08
between two locations.
9:10
With IP routing, we're always concerned
9:13
about the IP subnetting and the next hop
9:15
that we're going to use.
9:16
But with MPLS, we make forwarding decisions
9:19
based on the label switching.
9:21
This label switching is something
9:23
that's added when we put information
9:25
into the MPLS network.
9:27
If we have data and we have information
9:29
on one side of the network, and we
9:31
would like that data to get to the other side of the MPLS
9:34
network, we send that data into the first provider edge
9:37
router that's closest to us.
9:39
That edge router is going to insert a label into this data.
9:43
We call that pushing the label onto the data.
9:46
It's going to then know how to forward
9:48
that traffic through the internals of the provider
9:51
switch network, and when this data reaches
9:53
the other side that label is popped off
9:56
of this communication.
9:57
And the remaining data is sent to the customer edge router.
10:01
With MPLS, we have to create an initial configuration that
10:05
defines where all of the different sites may be located
10:08
and what labels may be used to switch data to those locations.
10:12
Other types of wide area networks
10:14
could create network connections dynamically,
10:16
so that you're only connecting to those sites
10:18
when you need to.
10:20
This commonly uses MGRE, which is Multipoint Generic Router
10:23
Encapsulation, and you'll usually see networks
10:26
like a dynamic multipoint VPN, or DMVPN,
10:30
used to send data across one of these MGRE networks.
10:35
What's nice about these dynamic connections
10:37
is they're only created when they're needed,
10:39
and they're torn down when you don't have any information
10:42
that you need to send.
10:43
If you have a break in any of the connections,
10:45
the VPN can even rebuild itself to be
10:48
able to communicate between all of these different sites.
10:51
All of this is considered to be a dynamic mesh because you're
10:54
able to send data to whatever site
10:56
you would like based on where that data needs to go.
10:59
Normally, you would have a main office,
11:01
and you would have remote sites that
11:03
would connect to the main office over single links.
11:06
And if you needed to communicate between remote sites,
11:09
that remote site would have to first communicate
11:11
to the main office, and then the main office
11:13
would have to communicate down to that destination site.
11:15
With a dynamic multipoint VPN, you
11:18
can have these two sites recognize
11:20
that they want to communicate to each other,
11:22
they create their own link between the communication,
11:25
and when that link is no longer needed, it's disconnected.
11:28
If this site needs now to connect
11:30
to a different remote site, it can then
11:32
create a separate dynamic link to that site,
11:35
and of course you can have that site create
11:37
a dynamic link as needed.
11:39
All of these dynamic multipoint links
11:42
mean that you have a more efficient network.
11:44
You're only using connectivity when you have to have it,
11:47
and if you do need to send information between two
11:49
remote sites, you can send that data directly rather than
11:53
hopping through a main office.
11:56
A newer type of wide area network
11:57
is an SD wide area network, or SDWAN.
12:01
The SD stands for Software Defined, which
12:04
means that our wide area network can be defined however
12:08
we would like to lay it out.
12:09
This is especially useful if you have cloud-based applications
12:13
and you need the network to understand where data needs
12:16
to go at any particular time.
12:19
We used to have a data center that
12:20
was located in one central building,
12:22
and we simply connected all of our remote sites
12:25
to that one data center.
12:26
Now that we have cloud based applications,
12:29
we need to communicate to the cloud.
12:31
And instead of having to hop through this data center
12:34
to be able to access those cloud-based resources,
12:36
we can have the wide area network recognize
12:39
that we need to communicate directly to those resources
12:42
rather than sending all of that data
12:44
through one central data center.
12:47
Here's our wide area networks before we
12:49
had cloud-based services and before we had software
12:52
defined wide area networks.
12:54
We had our data center.
12:55
Inside of our data center were all
12:57
of our services, our email servers, our database servers,
13:00
and all of our other data.
13:02
All of these remote sites would need
13:04
to connect to the data center to be able to gain access
13:06
to those resources.
13:08
With cloud-based services, we've taken our email services,
13:11
we've moved them to the cloud.
13:12
All of our servers are now at a cloud provider,
13:16
and we might have our databases inside yet another cloud
13:19
provider.
13:20
Instead of having all these remote sites then
13:22
communicate to this central data center, and then hop
13:25
to all of these cloud-based services,
13:27
we could have our wide area network automatically
13:30
know where to send the data based on the type of data
13:33
that it is.
13:34
So if a remote site needs to access
13:36
data that's in a cloud database, they
13:38
can access that information directly from the cloud.
13:41
If another site needs to grab an email message that's
13:44
located in a cloud-based email service,
13:47
they can communicate directly to that email service instead
13:50
of hopping through a central data center.
13:52
The determination of how this data is routed
13:55
is in the wide area network itself.
13:57
That software defined aspect of the SDWAN
14:01
determines how data is rooted and sent
14:03
based on the type of services that are required.
14:06
This makes for a much more efficient network.
14:09
This allows us to have instant access
14:11
to our cloud-based resources instead
14:13
of having to hop through a central point
14:15
or build out a separate network to gain access
14:18
to those resources.
